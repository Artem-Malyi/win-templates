Visual Studio solution, that contains templates of VS projects with minimal executables, like .exe, .dll and .sys<br/>
User mode executables, .exe and .dll do not depend on traditional visual studio runtime, so the output binaries will have minimal size, while being capable of running on differen Windows OS versions<br/>
